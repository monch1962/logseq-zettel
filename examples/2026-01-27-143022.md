## Quick Thought
The Lindy Effect suggests that the future life expectancy of non-perishable things like technology or ideas is proportional to their current age. The longer something has existed, the longer it's likely to continue existing.

## To Develop
- [ ] Expand into permanent note
- [ ] Find connections
- [ ] Add references

## Raw Capture
Lindy Effect = tech/ideas that have lasted are likely to keep lasting. Counterintuitive in fast-moving tech world.
