# 2026-01-27-143230 - Permanent Note

**Concept**: Cognitive Biases in Decision Making
**Developed**: 2026-01-27 14:32
**Context**: development

## Claim
Cognitive biases systematically distort decision-making by causing predictable deviations from rational judgment, and understanding these biases can improve decision quality.

## Evidence
1. **Anchoring**: Initial information disproportionately influences subsequent judgments (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
2. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence
3. **Availability Heuristic**: Judging probability based on ease of recall rather than actual frequency
4. **Loss Aversion**: Losses loom larger than equivalent gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)

## Implications
1. **Personal Decisions**: Awareness of biases can lead to better life choices (career, investments, relationships)
2. **Organizational Design**: Systems and processes should be designed to mitigate bias effects
3. **Policy Making**: Public policies should account for predictable human irrationality
4. **Education**: Critical thinking education should include bias recognition training
