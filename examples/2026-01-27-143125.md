## Summary
Kahneman introduces two systems of thinking: System 1 (fast, automatic, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, analytical). Most of our thinking is System 1, but System 2 is needed for complex reasoning.

## Key Quotes
"The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people's mistakes than our own."

"System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving."

## My Thoughts
The System 1/System 2 framework explains many cognitive biases. System 1's efficiency comes at the cost of accuracy, leading to predictable errors.
